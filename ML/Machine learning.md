# Machine learning

## week1

### Definition

### supervised learning

- Definition

- Housing price prediction
  - we gave it a data set of houses in which for every example in this data set, we told it what is the right price
  - the task of the algorithm was to just produce more of these right answers 
  - **regression problem**: predict continuous valued output(price here)

- Breast cancer
  - **classification problem**: predict results in a discrete valued output (0 or 1 here)
  - take tumor size as one attribute
  - **we can also have infinite number of attribute (attribute list)**

### Unsupervised learning

- Definition: derive structure from data by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data (when we have no idea what results look like)

- Clustering
  - Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on
- Non-clustering
  - The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a [cocktail party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)).
